#  Student–Parent Contact Management System (C++)

A **console-based contact management system** developed in **C++** that demonstrates the practical use of **Data Structures** such as **Stack, Queue, and Vector**.  
This project is suitable for **DSA mini-projects, lab work, and academic submissions**.

---

##  Features

-  Add student/parent contacts  
-  View recently added contact (Stack – LIFO)  
-  Undo last added contact  
-  Send messages in order (Queue – FIFO)  
-  List all contacts  
-  Search contact by ID  
-  Menu-driven interface

##  Featured Concepts Covered

This project covers the following **important programming and data structure concepts**:

### 🔹 C++ Programming Concepts
- Structures (`struct`)
- Functions & modular programming
- Standard Template Library (STL)
- Input/Output handling (`cin`, `cout`, `getline`)
- Menu-driven program design

### 🔹 Data Structures & Algorithms
- **Stack (LIFO)**  
  - Used for tracking recently added contacts  
  - Demonstrates undo operation  

- **Queue (FIFO)**  
  - Used for sending messages in correct order  
  - Simulates real-world task scheduling  

- **Vector (Dynamic Array)**  
  - Stores all contact records  
  - Allows dynamic resizing and traversal  

- **Searching Algorithm**
  - Linear search for contact lookup by ID  

### 🔹 Problem-Solving Concepts
- Real-world data modeling
- Efficient data organization
- Logical flow control
- Separation of concerns using functions
